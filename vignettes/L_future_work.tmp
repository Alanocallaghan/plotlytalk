## Future work

I will continue to add to this package as needed for my work, and in case.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to suggest them to me personally,
or to [open an issue](https://github.com/alanocallaghan/plotlyutils/issues).
It will help greatly if suggestions are one or more of the following:

1. Easy to implement (in which case consider submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/alanocallaghan/plotlyutils/pulls))
2. Useful for me
3. Likely to lead to fame and fortune
